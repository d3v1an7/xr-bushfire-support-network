<p>We are a small group of volunteers from around Australia who are heartbroken by the devastation and bushfires, and are desperate to help those affected any way we can.</p>
<p>If you're able to help, please <a href="{{ site.links.volunteer }}">sign up here</a>.
<p>If you (or someone you know) have been affected by the bushfires and are after some extra hands to help, <a href="{{ site.links.request }}">please get in touch here</a>.</p>
